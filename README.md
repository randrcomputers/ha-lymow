Unofficial Home Assistant integration for the **Lymow robot lawn mower**.  
Control your robot, monitor its status, view zones and map — all from Home Assistant.

**Maintained fork** of [d3dfantasy99/Lymow-HA](https://github.com/d3dfantasy99/Lymow-HA) (`2.1.15-beta.4`), published as **2.1.16**. The original author has been inactive; this repo exists so the integration keeps working on current Home Assistant.

> ⚠️ **This integration is not affiliated with or endorsed by Lymow.**  
> It was built by reverse engineering the official Lymow Android app.

### Fork notes (2.1.16)

Home Assistant **2026.9.0** (Python 3.14) was crashing the map camera with:

`Lymow map render failed - BrokenProcessPool: A child process terminated abruptly, the process pool is not usable anymore`

2.1.15-beta defaults to rendering the map and coverage math in a `ProcessPoolExecutor`. When that child process dies, the pool is unusable until a reload. This fork:

- Defaults **Render map in a separate process** to **off**
- Falls back to in-process render if the pool dies anyway
- Recovers coverage compute the same way

If you already had the option enabled, turn it off under **Settings → Devices & services → Lymow → Configure**, then reload.

- 🗺️ **Map camera** — diagnostic PNG rendered from S3 backup map with zone polygons, robot position, dock location and mow path overlay
- 📡 **Live camera** — RTSP stream from the robot's onboard camera, transcoded to HLS by HA's built-in `stream` component
- 🌍 **GeoJSON sensor** — full zone map as a GeoJSON FeatureCollection (WGS84) for use with custom Lovelace map cards or external apps
- 🎛️ **Mow mode selector** — change cutting pattern (Zigzag, Chess Board, Perimeter Only, Adaptive Zigzag)
- 📦 **Firmware update notifications** — HA Updates panel shows available OTA versions with release notes
- 📋 **Session history events** — `event.lymow_session_completed` fires on every completed mow with area, duration, battery and zones
- 🔄 **Multi-region** — Europe, Asia Pacific (Sydney & Hong Kong), US East
- 🔁 **Token auto-refresh** — stays logged in, no manual intervention needed

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.1** or newer
- A Lymow account created with **email and password** or Google login
- Your robot must be paired to that account via the official Lymow app

> ⚠️ **Apple login is not supported.**  
> Those accounts use OAuth2 with a mobile deep link (`myapp://callback`) that cannot be replicated in a headless environment.

## Services

### `lymow.start_zones`
Start mowing one or more specific zones by hashId or name.

```yaml
service: lymow.start_zones
data:
  zones:
    - "vfW8PgjE"       # hashId
    - "Front Lawn"     # or zone name
```

### `lymow.dock_cancel_task`
Return to dock **and cancel** the current task (no recharge-resume).

```yaml
service: lymow.dock_cancel_task
```

### `lymow.cancel_task`
Stop the robot in place and reset to waiting state (equivalent to "Cancel task" in the app).

```yaml
service: lymow.cancel_task
```

> For integrations with multiple robots, add `device_id: <device_id>` to target a specific one.

## Coverage & mow history

Per-zone coverage and last-mowed times **persist across restarts and new mows** — they're
saved to the integration's config entry, not just held in memory. Each zone keeps its mowed
footprint on the map, tinted by **mow-age** (brighter = mowed more recently, fading as it
ages past your **Mow Interval**), and the **Overdue Zones** / **Zone Age** sensors track how
long it's been since each zone was last cut. A zone you mowed last week still shows its
coverage today, and starting a fresh task only clears the zone(s) actually being mowed — so a
partial mow never wipes the rest of the map.

---

## Session history automations

The `event.lymow_<<mowername>>_last_session` entity fires whenever a new completed session is detected. Use it to send a notification when mowing finishes:

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: event.lymow_<<mowername>>_last_session
  action:
    service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      title: "Mowing complete"
      message: >
        Mowed {{ state_attr('event.lymow_<<mowername>>_last_session', 'area_m2') }} m²
        in {{ (state_attr('event.lymow_<<mowername>>_last_session', 'duration_s') / 60) | round }} min.
        Used {{ state_attr('event.lymow_<<mowername>>_last_session', 'used_battery') }}% battery.
```

> Replace `<<mowername>>` with your own enitity mower name.

---

## Map card (GeoJSON)

The `sensor.lymow_map_geojson` attribute `geojson` contains a standard GeoJSON FeatureCollection with zone polygons, dock position and robot position (WGS84). Use it with a custom Lovelace map card:

```yaml
type: custom:map-card
fit_to_markers: true
entities:
  - entity: sensor.lymow_map_geojson
    geojson:
      attribute: geojson
      filter:
        property: type
        value: zone
      color: "#00c853"
      fill_opacity: 0.25
  - entity: sensor.lymow_map_geojson
    geojson:
      attribute: geojson
      filter:
        property: type
        value: mow_path
      color: "#ff6f00"
      fill_opacity: 0
```

---

## Example automations

### Alert if the mower leaves its mapped area

The **Location State** sensor (`sensor.lymow_<<mowername>>_location_state`) reads `Docked`,
`Zone: <name>`, `Channel: <label>`, `No Go: <name>`, or `Off-Map`. `No Go:` and `Off-Map` are
geofence breaches (also exposed via the `is_breach` attribute), so you can notify or alarm the
moment the mower goes where it shouldn't:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Lymow left its mapped area"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.lymow_<<mowername>>_location_state
        to: "Off-Map"
        for: "00:00:30"            # debounce brief GPS wobble
    action:
      - service: notify.notify
        data:
          message: "⚠️ Lymow is outside its mapped area (possible theft, or stuck off-map)."
```

### Sound the theft alarm if it leaves the yard

Combine the Location State sensor with the mower's built-in audio — play its **Theft Alarm**
clip when it goes Off-Map:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Lymow theft alarm"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.lymow_<<mowername>>_location_state
        to: "Off-Map"
        for: "00:00:30"
    action:
      - service: lymow.play_sound
        data:
          audio_id: 31              # 31 = Theft Alarm
```

### Playing sounds

Use the **Play Sound** select (pick a clip; it auto-resets to `None`) or call the
`lymow.play_sound` service with `audio_id` — these are the mower's own **built-in audio
clips** (e.g. `30` Stop Button Pressed, `31` Theft Alarm, `32` Cutting Started), not custom
tones. Fire-and-forget: the mower has no audio feedback, so the select snaps back after firing.

## Troubleshooting

### Enable debug logging

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.lymow: debug
```

Logs will appear in **Settings → System → Logs**.

### Common issues

**Integration not found after installation**  
→ Make sure you restarted Home Assistant after copying the files.

**Login fails**  
→ Confirm you are using an account created with **email and password**, not Google or Apple.  
→ Try logging in with the same credentials in the official Lymow app to verify they are correct.

**All sensors unavailable**  
→ The robot may be offline or out of WiFi/4G range. Check the **Online** binary sensor.  
→ Enable debug logging and look for connection errors.

**Map is empty**  
→ The robot needs to have completed at least one mapping session. The map is loaded from the S3 backup map and may take one polling cycle to appear after restart.

**Live camera not working**  
→ The robot's IP must be reachable from the HA host (same LAN or VPN). Check `sensor.lymow_camera_url` for the RTSP address. A DHCP reservation for the robot is recommended.

**Blade height shows Unknown**  
→ The firmware does not expose a global blade height. The value is read from the first zone's configuration and becomes available after the map is loaded.
