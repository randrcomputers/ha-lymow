"""Lymow path engine — cut/planned split, session cut-track accumulation, and
deviation (obstacle-avoidance) detection.

The QUERY_PATH response is one flat point list (PbPoint x/y, ENU metres) split by
sentinel markers into segments. Verified on hardware (2026-06-01):
  * the small segment that tracks the mower and grows each pull = the CUT/ACTUAL path
  * the large static segments that span the zone = the PLANNED route (computed once)
Since planned is static, points where the ACTUAL path departs from it are where the
mower re-routed around an obstacle → deviation = obstacle avoidance.

Concept (per-zone history + heat-map) ported from Mortimer452/Lymow-One-MQTT (MIT).
