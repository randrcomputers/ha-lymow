"""Plan-free obstacle detection from coverage holes.

We never receive a planned route, so obstacles can't be found as "actual vs planned
deviations". Instead: an obstacle is an UN-MOWED island fully surrounded by mowed area
inside a go-zone (the mower routed around it), and NOT explained by a no-go zone. Holes
connected to the not-yet-mowed frontier / zone edge are excluded by a flood-fill, so this
works progressively during a mow and cleanly at the end.
