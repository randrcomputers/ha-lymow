"""Double-coverage / single-pass analysis for checkerboard mows.

A crosshatch ("chess") mow should cover every spot TWICE — once per infill axis.
Where the interior is covered by only ONE infill axis, Lymow's planner abandoned the
perpendicular return pass there (a real, submittable path-planning bug).

Key design (learned the hard way 2026-06-04): measure double-coverage on the two INFILL
axes ONLY. Perimeter-following laps are inherently one-directional, so if we counted them
the whole boundary ring reads "single-pass". By excluding perimeter rows, the ring falls
out as "covered by neither infill axis" and is correctly ignored — with NO erosion, so
narrow tails/appendages (where real give-ups also happen) survive.
