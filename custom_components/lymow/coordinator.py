"""DataUpdateCoordinator for Lymow — MQTT push-driven.

State arrives via MQTT /pboutput broadcasts.
Commands are published to /pbinput as protobuf messages.

Startup + periodic refresh:
  On connect:
    build_initial_query_packets() → map, path, schedules, cleaning info,
                                      appConnect, debug profile/WiFi, robot config, net detail, WiFi/4G, RTK L1/L2

  Every _REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 90s):
    build_refresh_query_packets()
    (ensures IP address, signal info and RTK stay current without the app open)

  On MQTT disconnect:
    Refresh AWS credentials (they expire after ~1h causing the disconnect)
    Re-create paho connection with a new presigned URL
    Re-fire startup queries

REST poll every 15 min: device online/offline fallback.
