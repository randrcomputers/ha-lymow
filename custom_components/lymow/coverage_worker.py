"""Pure coverage-compute worker, isolated so it can run in a ProcessPoolExecutor child.

The heavy coverage math (point-in-polygon attribution + zone rasterisation) is GIL-bound
pure Python and, on a large lawn, blocks HA's event loop for 0.5–1.8s per tick (measured —
see bench.py). Running it here, imported into a spawned subprocess, keeps that work off the
loop. This module deliberately imports ONLY the pure compute modules (no coordinator / HA),
so the child stays light and import-safe.

All inputs/outputs are plain builtins (lists/tuples/dicts) so they pickle across the process
boundary cleanly.
