"""Lymow zone stats — attribute coverage and obstacle events to zones.

There is no per-zone breakdown in the cloud telemetry (cleanZoneIds/mowOrder are
NOT present), so attribution is GEOMETRIC: a cut point or obstacle-event center is
assigned to whichever zone polygon contains it (ray-casting point-in-polygon, ENU
metres). This gives per-zone coverage and obstacle counts that the sticky-zone /
completion model (zone_stats stage 2) and per-zone entities build on.

Honest limits (see ZONE_ANALYTICS_DESIGN.md): coverage = accumulated cut points,
not a ground-truth swath; overlapping zones attribute a point to the first match.
